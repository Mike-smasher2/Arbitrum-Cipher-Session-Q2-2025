## ✅ Tasks

### 1. Setup a Crypto Wallet

You’ll need a wallet to interact with Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains.

We recommend **[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)** – a browser extension and mobile app wallet.

#### 🔧 Steps

1. Go to [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/) and download the extension for your browser.
2. Create a new wallet.
3. **Securely back up your seed phrase.**  
   - Write it down and store it in a safe place.  
   - Do **NOT** take screenshots or store it online.

#### ⚠️ Important Warnings

- **NEVER share your seed phrase or private key with anyone.**
- **DO NOT upload your seed phrase to GitHub or anywhere online.**
- Losing your seed phrase = losing your funds forever.

### 2. Contribute to the Project Repository

Repo: [Celo Cipher Session Q2 2025](https://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub-UNN/Celo-Cipher-Session-Q2-2025)

You'll practice basic Git and GitHub skills by contributing your wallet address to the class repo.

#### 📁 What to do

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Celo-Cipher-Session-Q2-2025.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the `week-0` folder.
4. Create a new text file named after your **first name**, e.g.:

   ```
   emmanuel.txt
   ```

5. Paste your **wallet address** (not private key!) inside that file.

6. Stage, commit, and push your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "added my wallet address - Emmanuel"
   git push origin main
   ```

7. Go to your fork on GitHub and create a **Pull Request** to the original repo.
